# Node Pokémon Battler

This aim of this project was to build a [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) battler game using object oriented programming and test driven development in JavaScript which can be run from the command line using node.

I decided to recently take on this project to re-cement OOP programming principles, as well to learn node inquirer package.

This project requires the inquirer package in node, which can be installed using npm from the root folder of the project in the terminal:

npm install

To run the game, run the following script from the root folder:

npm run pokemon

The game will then appear in the CLI using inquirer, and allow you to battle to your hearts content!
