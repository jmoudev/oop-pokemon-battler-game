# Node Pokémon Battler

This aim of this project is to build a [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) battler game using object oriented programming and test driven development in JavaScript which can be run from the command line using node.

I first tackled this project on the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp, and I thought I would revisit the project from scratch following my further 7 weeks of experience in JavaScript to re-cement OOP programming principles.

The current game includes some well known gen 1 pokémon.

Project run requirements and required tech TBC. Jest is used for testing.
